Made for the community, By the community! Our primary goals are: - Micro-Service Centered - Native Kubernetes - Stability - Consistancy All our apps are supposed to work together, be easy to setup using the TrueNAS UI and, above all, give the average user more than enough options to tune things to their liking. Getting started using TrueCharts \u00b6 \u00b6 Installing TrueCharts within TrueNAS SCALE, is possible using the TrueNAS SCALE Catalog list. For more information: https://truecharts.org/manual/adding-truecharts/ Support \u00b6 Please check our FAQ , manual and Issue tracker There is a significant chance your issue has been reported before! Still something not working as expected? Contact us! and we'll figure it out together! Roadmap \u00b6 For big \"breaking\" changes we do have a roadmap during the ALPHA and BETA stages of TrueNAS SCALE. Assuming the release dates of TrueNAS SCALE will keep following the previous 2 months between releases, we will have the following big milestones: Features and Polishing - TrueNAS SCALE 21.06 This release going to focus on polishing some of the ugly ALPHA code we wrote and add some exciting new features. We'll also start working on providing more solid testing and compatibility with users that want to use native-helm on SCALE. SCALE ALL THE APPS - TrueNAS SCALE 21.08 Beta has landed by now and people want their apps available on scale. Lets give them what they want! Development \u00b6 Our development proces is fully distributed and agile, so every chart-maintainer is free to set their own roadmap and development speed and does not have to comply to a centralised roadmap. This ensures freedom and flexibility for everyone involved and makes sure you, the end user, always has the latest and greated of every App installed. Getting into creating Apps \u00b6 Creating charts takes some getting used to, as it's based on Helm charts. We highly suggest prior knowhow on creation/modifying Helm Charts, before taking on the challenge of creating SCALE Apps. For more information on creating SCALE Apps and Helm charts, please check out our development manual Automation and you \u00b6 We provide a lot of tools to make it easier to develop charts, templates, automated testing, automated fixes, automated docs. Even automated update is included. We also actively try to collaborate with other k8s community projects on tooling, for the betterment of all! Those tools do, however, take time to develop and are certainly not bug free. If you find mistakes in our tooling, please feel free to repost issues or submit any fixes you feel appropiate! Contact and Support \u00b6 \u00b6 To contact the TrueCharts project: - Create an issue on Github issues - Open a discussion on GitHub Discussions - Send us an email - Or join our Discord server Featured Projects \u00b6 A lot of our work is based on the great effort of others.

A: TrueNAS SCALE 20.12 has never supported custom charts in any way, shape or form. Hence TrueCharts is 21.04+ only Q: Please include app X A: Please file an issue about it, after checking the wiki to make sure it hasn't been discussed already: https://github.com/truecharts/apps/wiki/k8s-at-home-to-SCALE-App-migration-list Q: Isn't there more documentation for app x A: If it's not on our website , we do not. There might be other sources for documentation however! Q: Function x doesn't seem to be working, should it be working? A: Maybe, please file an issue Q: I'm missing a lot of configuration opions in the install GUI. A: We try to aim for a balance in the amount of options vs the simplicity of installation. Suggestions are always welcome Q: Is my data guaranteed to be secure? A: ix_volumes (the auto generated storage) is considered relatively secure as long as you don't delete the App, but we can't give an absolute guarantee. data mounted using a hostPath, is as secure as the application that is using the data, our charts do not actively alter said dataset/folder. However: SCALE is still ALPHA, so breaking changes in the storage design are very likely. Q: sabnzbd isn't starting. A: SabNZBD has a weird security implementation that requires you to add the hostname or IP adress to their config file. In the future we might automate this proces, but currently we do not. Q: An app is asking for a password. A: We almost allways use the defaults from the upstream project, if we are forced to use a password and not add the option to change it in the install GUI.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"about/#faq","text":"Q: I tried to run TrueCharts on TrueNAS SCALE 20.12 or 21.02 and it doesn't work.

These guidelines will be examplained here, in this document. GIT Guidelines \u00b6 New to GIT \u00b6 If you have never used git before, you can look up our general reference on our wiki. Git and You \u00b6 GIT is a fantastic system, but while using it we have a few guidelines to keep it fantastic for everyone. Submit complete PR's. Add [DNM] if you do not want your PR merged yet. Always try and fill in the whole form, even for small PR's. Don't close when a reviewer requests changes (just push the changes or ask for help). Explain what you did in your PR. Be thorough. If you can add screenshots to clarify. Always try to add \"Fixes #000\" (where 000 is the Issue your PR fixes) found something you want to fix yourself? Please do make an issue too. Structure Guidelines \u00b6 Inclusion of files and folders \u00b6 Although GIT is quite friendly in what it accepts in terms of files and folder changes in a commit, a reviewer's or bugfixer's time is not unlimited. For that reason, we have a few specific guidelines in regards to the inclusion of files and folders in your PR. Only include files you actually changed. Try not to include multiple changes in one PR Want to change the formatting of multiple files too? Make a separate PR. Code Guidelines \u00b6 Your code, your style, my review \u00b6 Here at TrueCharts, we value people having their own style. But your code needs to be reviewable and editable by others too. For that reason, we have a few basic coding guidelines Always explain regex in a comment within your code. Write simple code and don't try to impress. We will run (Basic) automated reformating of code once in a while. Document your changes in your code and if need be, on the wiki. All PR's should be able to pass our automated tests. Apps requirements \u00b6 Apps should always save user-specific data in a persistant location. That can be connected by both IXVolume or Hostpath Apps should not require the user to edit any config file themselves. All config changes should be either automated or using the UI Apps should not use default passwords, the user should always be forced(!) to put credentials in manually Review Guidelines \u00b6 Even us review gods need some guidelines once in a while. Let people learn from their mistakes Review instead of merging without comments Abide by these guidelines in your review Tests exist for a reason.

Todo: When you come across something that needs tweaking/adding during development, is not an unexpected behavior Feature: When you, out of personal preference, want something added or changed.

If you get lost at any point in this guide, don't be afraid to ask. There are tons of friendly dudes and dudettes who will answer all your questions. First thing first \u00b6 You will need these to start your journey: A GitHub account . You'll also need to download Git from this link https://git-scm.com/, this is different from GitHub and will allow you to download and upload TrueCharts and your personal changes Setting up your dev environment \u00b6 If you already know what you're doing, go to our GitHub and fork. Otherwise, look at this picture, from now on this will be the contribution cycle . This is how our workflow will look at the end of the tutorial. What's that? You have no idea what any of that means? Worry not, my fellow contributor! I will guide you step by step. First, you did your GitHub account account as suggested, right? Good. We will now visit the TrueCharts Repository in GitHub and click this little button located at the top right corner of the page: As the hint suggests, this will create your very own copy of TrueCharts under your account. This copy is yours and you can do whatever you want with it, but in order to contribute, you will need to comply with some good practices I'll tell you in a second. Good, now we just need GIT. You don't know what a GIT is? Well, GIT is a Version Control Software designed to deal with the problem of having multiple people modifying the same files at the same time. In other words, we need it. If we don't use it, the project would descend into chaos. At this point, you have a very important decision to make. It is like the type of Pok\u00e9mon you choose to start your adventure... You want GIT with GUI or CLI ? I will describe the starting steps for both now, so you can make your mind. (OSX and Linux come with GIT CLI installed!) At a later stage you might also want to pick your own GUI, like GitKraken or SourceTree Downloading GIT and Dependencies \u00b6 First of all, you need to download Git from this link https://git-scm.com/, this is also a great stage to install GIT with GUI or your own GIT GUI. Optionally With TrueCharts we use some custom tools to make sure you have the least amount of work possible when working on the project. However, this means you need some custom tools before you can start working on TrueCharts: Git (git client optional) Python (including Pip, added to path on windows) Pre-Commit (prefered) When on Windows install Python3 with the installer available here: (https://www.python.org/downloads/), Be sure to check \"Add to Path\" during installation. After that's finished installing, restart your computer then you can continue with setting up the project. Cloning from your GitHub \u00b6 You are here : After Forking from TrueCharts central repo ( upstream ), we need to clone from our fork so we get the files into your computer ( Local repo ). GitHub Desktop Git Bash Navigate to the folder where you want to save the files git clone https://github.com/YourUser/YourRepo.git Adding the central repo as a remote \u00b6 Are you done downloading? Awesome! Now your local repo is automagically soul-linked with your remote repo in GitHub (remember we call this origin ). We're going to also link the central repo and name it upstream GitHub Desktop Git Bash This is automagically done Navigate to the folder where your local repo is git remote add upstream https://github.com/truecharts/apps.git Now to make sure everything is in order, we do git remote -v and it should show both repos, yours in origin and central in upstream Setting up Pre-Commit \u00b6 Pre-Commit makes sure to fix small warnings that might prevent us from merging your changes into our repo. For now it isn't really important why, how and what. But realise it does so in each step called \"commit\" in the future. To setup Pre-Commit on windows, simply double click tools/pre-commit-install.bat , on Linux you can install pre-commit by using pip install pre-commit and pre-commit install from the project top-most directory Opening the project and editing the project \u00b6 By now you would have a complete copy of TrueCharts to play with. Use your favorite editor to edit them and/or follow other guides to make the changes you want! What follows in this guide is how to get your changes into the TrueCharts official catalog Final step in your setup! \u00b6 After some playing around you might notice it created changes you don't want to keep. Said files should not be committed when you request your other changes to be integrated into the TrueCharts. Let's go and discard all of them... GitHub Desktop Git Bash Go to the changes tab. In my case, I have 2 changes Now right-click in the amount of changes and discard all git status will show you all the unstaged changes you currently have. git checkout . and git clean -f to get rid of all of them. You will be doing this a lot so make sure to learn it! Now that our master branch is completely clean we will create a new branch from it. Try to always have a feature branch you can play with and keep master pristine. What's a branch? Well, let's say it is like having a multiverse in your folder. In branch A you have a file called \"greeting.txt\" and its content is \"hello world\", while in branch B you have the same file but now its content is \"hello universe\". You can see how this is useful for us, so we have a version of the game that is common to everyone and you have your own version with the feature you're adding. We can later merge both branches and GIT will try its best to do it smoothly. So how do I create a new branch? GitHub Desktop Git Bash Click the current branch button All that's missing is to publish the new branch so your remote in GitHub ( origin ) is up to date git branch mybranch Where \"mybranch\" is the name you chose for your branch (be more creative than this, please). Then we do git checkout mybranch to change the current branch to mybranch instead of master Finally we publish our new branch doing git push Contribute to the central repo \u00b6 Committing and pushing your changes \u00b6 You are here: I strongly suggest you handle your changes in your IDE or GitHub Desktop. Remember to only commit those files you intended to change. In the case of GitHub Desktop, all you got to do is to select the files you wish to commit and click the commit button Now all that is missing is publishing your commits to your remote ( origin ) GitHub Desktop Git Bash git push origin Making a PR \u00b6 A P**ull **R**equest is the only way to get your changes into the central version of the game. You do a PR by **committing your changes and pushing them to your remote repo ( origin ). Then, visit the TrueCharts Repository in GitHub and click this green button: You will see a page where you can name your PR and fill a little form with the relevant information. Your PR will be tested and reviewed and once you answered all questions and processed all feedback, it will be accepted into TrueCharts! Updating your repo \u00b6 This is a chaotic project and stuff happens almost every day so it is very important that you keep your repo up-to-date, especially when mapping. GitHub Desktop Git Bash Click the current branch tab In the list find upstream/master git fetch --all git merge upstream/master You did it, you completed the tutorial! Now go back to the first time I showed you the Contribution cycle picture and see how you understand it a little better now! Here is a little resume of what we just saw: Set up Fork from the central repo (upstream) Clone from your remote repo (origin) to your local Create a feature branch Working \u200b 0. Update your repo from the central (upstream) Start working in your feature Commit to your local repo Push from your local to your remote (origin) Make a PR Now what? \u00b6 Well, feeling confused after messing around with the scenes and all? well, it's now time to actually learn to work on TrueCharts and TrueNAS SCALE Apps!

A library chart is a type of Helm chart that defines chart primitives or definitions which can be shared by Helm templates in other charts. This allows users to share snippets of code that can be re-used across charts, avoiding repetition and keeping charts DRY. The first version of our Common library was ported from k8s-at-home, which they introduced because they saw many charts requiring only a few select configuration options in their Helm charts. Let's take for example, Sonarr, Sabnzbd, Overseerr. Each of these charts only require setting service , port , persistence , ingress and image since state and app configuration is handled by the application itself.

A library chart is a type of Helm chart that defines chart primitives or definitions which can be shared by Helm templates in other charts. This allows users to share snippets of code that can be re-used across charts, avoiding repetition and keeping charts DRY. The first version of our Common library was ported from k8s-at-home, which they introduced because they saw many charts requiring only a few select configuration options in their Helm charts. Let's take for example, Sonarr, Sabnzbd, Overseerr. Each of these charts only require setting service , port , persistence , ingress and image since state and app configuration is handled by the application itself.

Please be aware that those refer to the same system. An Ingress is, simply put, just Kubernetes way of connecting outsides to Apps running in containers. Ingress Types \u00b6 We currently support: - HTTP via Ingres - HTTP via Traefik IngressRoute (HTTP-IR) - TCP via Traefik IngressRouteTCP - UDP via Traefik IngressRouteUDP From questions.yaml and the UI, these can be changed with selecting another \"Type\".

The example configurations below contain a mostly complete overview of what is currently available and reasonable. Ingress and Services \u00b6 It's important to know what Ingress does, before you start creating ingresses in questions.yaml. Ingresses send outside Traffic, to a kubernetes Service, which in turn forwards traffic to the actual containers. This means that every container needs to know how to reach their Service. If they do not, things go wrong. To ensure this, it's adviced to keep the names of your Ingresses the same as the names of your services. We made sure the ingress would automatically detect (and connect to) the main port of a Service with the same name.

Where the main Service is used for healthchecks and the \"portal\" button, the main Ingress is just used for the portal button.

When not creating new charts, most of what this project does is stitching together questions.yaml files to turn existing Helm Charts into Apps. Syntax \u00b6 In this document we give you a short reference guide (ported from IX Official) which lays out the settings available in questions.yaml. Question Variable Reference \u00b6 Variable Type Required Description variable string true define the variable name specified in the values.yaml file. label string true define the UI label. description string false specify the description of the variable. group string false group questions by input value. schema dictionary true specify schema details for the variable schema.type string true specify type of value for variable (current supported types are string, int, boolean, path, hostpath, list, dict, ipaddr, and cron). schema.required bool false define if the variable is required or not (true false), defaults to false schema.default object false specify the default value. schema.min_length int false min character length for string type variable. schema.max_length int false max character length for string type variable. schema.min int false min integer length. schema.max int false max integer length. schema.enum []dictionary false specify the options when the variable type is string , for example, enum: - value: \"RollingUpdate\" description: \"Create new pods and then kill old ones\" - value: \"Recreate\" description: \"Kill existing pods before creating new ones\" schema.valid_chars string false regular expression for input chars validation. schema.subquestions []subquestion false add an array of subquestions. schema.show_if string false show current variable if condition specified is true, for example show_if: [[\"workloadType\", \"=\", \"CronJob\"]] schema.show_subquestions_if string false show subquestions if is true or equal to one of the options. for example show_subquestion_if: \"static\" . system will convert this to the filters format specifid for shcema.show_if automatically. schema.attrs []variables false specified when schema.type is dictionary to declare attributes allowed in the dictionary. schema.items []variables false specified when schema.type is list to declare attributes allowed in the list. schema.private bool false specified for declaring information sensitive fields. schema.null bool false specifies if the value for the variable can be null. defaults to false. Subquestions \u00b6 subquestions[] cannot contain subquestions or show_subquestions_if keys, but all other keys in the above table are supported. Also variables having schema.type list do not support subquestions . Special Questions \u00b6 There are some novel cases where we would like to provide ability to configure / manage resources for workloads with getting some data from system dynamically. So a chart can specify certain actions to be performed by the system for a variable by defining a reference. An example better illustrates this concept: - variable: volume label: \"Volume\" schema: type: dict $ref: - \"normalize/ixVolume\" attrs: - variable: mountPath label: \"Mount Path\" description: \"Path where the volume will be mounted inside the pod\" schema: type: path required: true - variable: datasetName label: \"Dataset Name\" schema: type: string required: true In the above variable we define a $ref in schema which specifies that the system should take some action for normalising the value specified for the variable. In this specific case, ix_volume is a concept introduced where we recommend using a volume which we are able to rollback automatically on chart release rollback. In essence, it is just a hostPath volume for which the system automatically creates the dataset specified. We have following types of actions supported in $ref right now: 1) definitions 2) normalize For (1), system will automatically update schema for a particular definition. For example, - variable: hostInterface description: \"Please specify host interface\" label: \"Host Interface\" schema: type: string required: true $ref: - \"definitions/interface\" System will automatically populate available interfaces for the user based on what interfaces are available on the system. For (2), system will normalize values or perform some actions as discussed above. Standardised questions.yaml sections \u00b6 To minimise the maintenance load of our App collection, we always aim to standardise as much as possible. The same goes for questions.yaml. Included here are some code standardised code-snippets that are expected to be included in every App. Be aware that sometimes specific functions might or might not completely function. Leaving them out would, however, everely increase the maintenance load and often said functionality will be added in the common-chart later on anyway. Groups \u00b6 To make sure all apps stay somewhat the same, we use a list of standardised groups for the groups section. Please make sure to use these groups in your Apps: groups: - name: \"Container Image\" description: \"Image to be used for container\" - name: \"Workload Configuration\" description: \"Configure workload deployment\" - name: \"Configuration\" description: \"additional container configuration\" - name: \"Networking\" description: \"Configure Network and Services for container\" - name: \"Storage\" description: \"Persist and share data that is separate from the lifecycle of the container\" - name: \"Resources and Devices\" description: \"Specify resources/devices to be allocated to workload\" - name: \"Ingress Configuration\" description: \"Ingress Configuration\" - name: \"Security\" description: \"Configure security context\" - name: \"Advanced\" description: \"Advanced Configuration\" - name: \"WARNING\" description: \"WARNING\" General Configuration options \u00b6 These options are always* included because almost every chart (eventually) has a use for them and/or other parts of the common chart depend on them. They are called general options, because they affect the basic functionalities of a chart.

Running the tests \u00b6 Running these tests can be done any way you like. In this document we describe a number of approaches: Directly on your development machine Through a development container in Visual Studio Code Using a local Docker container Directly on your development machine \u00b6 First set up the environment: $ export RUBYJQ_USE_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES = 1 $ bundle install Run the tests: $ bundle exec m -r test/charts Using Visual Studio Code \u00b6 Our repo comes with a Visual Studio Code development container definition and launch.json that allow you to quickly set up an environment in which you can run the tests. Prerequisites \u00b6 Visual Studio Code is installed. Docker is installed and running. The \"Remote - Containers\" extension is installed and enabled in Visual Studio Code. For more details, please refer to the official documentation . Running tests \u00b6 Once Visual Studio Code is set up, and you open the charts workspace, you will see a popup asking if you wish to re-open the workspace in a development container: Select the option that you prefer. The workspace will be reopened and a Dockerized workspace will be built. You can now use Visual Studio Code as normal. To run or debug the unit tests, click the \"Run\" button on the left sidebar and select the desired configuration: UnitTest - active spec file only : This configuration will try to run the currently opened test file. Note: Make sure that you have opened a valid test file ( .rb files in the test/charts folder), or this will not work. UnitTest - all spec files : This configuration will run the all test files in the test/charts folder. Next, press the green \"Play\" icon. This will start the tests show the outcome in a terminal window. Using a local Docker container \u00b6 The Visual Studio Code development container can also be leveraged without using Visual Studio Code. Prerequisites \u00b6 Docker is installed and running. You have the charts repo root folder opened in your shell of choice. The commands in this article assume you are running a Bash-compatible shell. Running tests \u00b6 The first step is to build the development container image containing the required tools. This step only needs to be done once.

We support both self-signed, custom and lets-encrypt certificates, using the TrueNAS SCALE building certificate manager. Available under \"Credentials\" Self Signed certificates \u00b6 Self signed certificates are relatively straight forward and handled by Traefik itself. You just select \"self signed\" when adding a reverse-proxy to your App and Traefik does the rest! Please be aware that these certificates are not really secure, but are \"good enough\" for testing. Lets-Encrypt Certificates \u00b6 With the current version of TrueNAS SCALE, it's possible to automatically generate certificates for your domain(s) using letsencrypt. However, this process is not very clear, hence we added a short how-to guide on getting up-and-running with TrueNAS SCALE and Letsencrypt. After you managed to complete this how-to, you should be able to select \"iX Certificate\" as certificate option and your personal certificate in the other drop-down box! Requirements \u00b6 To use iX Certificates with letsencrypt there are a few requirements: - Preferably use a DNS server that doesn't have any caching (no local DNS server) for your TrueNAS system. - Have an email address entered for your TrueNAS SCALE root user. (this email will also be used for letsencrypt reminder!) - Own a domain name - Use either Cloudflare or AWS Route53 for your domain. (In case you wonder: Using Cloudflare as DNS provider is free) - Have an active internet connection so TrueNAS SCALE can contact Cloudflare or AWS to verify your domain ownership How-To \u00b6 Click Credentials in the Left side menu and go the Certificates page. Notice ACME DNS-Authenticators , select Add besides ACME DNS-Authenticators to open the menu for adding your DNS provider for domain verification. Enter the required information and click save . For Cloudflare you need either a global API-Key or a limited-scope API token. Please refer to cloudflare and/or AWS on how to get the required credentials. Notice Certificate Signing Requests , select Add besides Certificate Signing Requests to open the menu for adding the domain information you want a certificate for. Enter all information required in the wizard and save it. If you are not sure, the defaults are alsmost always \"alright\", because most of what you enter here is completely ignored by Letsencrypt. Common Name in this case means Primary domain name , whereas Subject Alternate Names means Extra domain names . Notice your new Certificate Signing Request showing up in the box below Certificate Signing Requests . Also notice the small wrench icon to the right of your Certificate Signing Request Click the small wrench icon, this will open the Create ACME Certificate menu. In this menu we can actually request either a real (Production) certificate or a testing (staging) certificate from Letsencrypt. For clearity, it's advicable to use the same Authenticator for all domain names. However: It's okey to generate both a testing and a staging certificate for the same domain. After saving and awaiting the generation proces, you should end up with another Certificate Signing Request and a new Certificate under Certificates , this new Certificate Signing Request is used to renew your Certificate in the future and should not be deleted! Import existing certificates \u00b6 TrueNAS SCALE also allows you to manually import certificates, this is rather straight forward: Copy-Paste the keys into their respective boxes and hit save Notes \u00b6 There are a few known bugs, issues and/or oddities currently in regards to Certificates Error during certificate creation \u00b6 ACME (the system doing letsencrypt) is not super stable on TrueNAS SCALE currently. This is a SCALE issue and not (directly) related to TrueCharts. We suggest the following steps to limit the chance of errors during certificate creation: Use the DNS-Authenticators DNS server as TrueNAS SCALE DNS server under \"Networking\". For example, for cloudflare this would be 1.1.1.1 Use global Cloudflare API keys, not zoned Tokens Reboot after ACME errors We sincerely hope iX Systems solves the ACME instabilities with due priority. Traefik not accepting/using certificates \u00b6 Sometimes you might notice Traefik ignores your certificate. This is most likely due to the domain on your certificate, being different from the domain you entered into the reverse proxy host box. Traefik requires your certificate to match the domain used for Ingress. This is an upstream design decision and something we can easily and safely disable.

The format for internal domain name for the main service is as follows, please replace $APPNAME with the name you gave your App when installing. $APPNAME.ix-$APPNAME.svc.cluster.local Kubernetes can usually identify the app when omitting svc.cluster.local as well: - $APPNAME.ix-$APPNAME If you need to reach a different service (which is not often the case!), you need a slightly different format, where $SVCNAME is the name of the service you want to reach: $SVCNAME.ix-$APPNAME.svc.cluster.local or $SVCNAME.ix-$APPNAME","title":"Linking Apps Internally"},{"location":"manual/linking/#example","text":"To reach an app named \"sabnzbd\" within Sonarr, we can use the following internal domain name: sabnzbd.ix-sabnzbd","title":"Example"},{"location":"manual/linking/#additional-documentation","text":"For more help troubleshooting DNS resolution in Kubernetes, review the official documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/","title":"Additional Documentation"},{"location":"manual/networking/","text":"Networking \u00b6 TrueCharts contain a number of networking options, some super-easy, others quite-advanced.
